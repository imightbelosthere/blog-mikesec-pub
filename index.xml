          Who&amp;rsquo;s hands behind the keyboard? I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a fair question to ask, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep this in a way that I respect my privacy, but I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m an IT Security Professional, who&amp;rsquo;s been an hacker its whole life and got driven always through self-motivation.
I had of course on my side my friends, my wife and professionals who challenged me along the way to become better and learn from each and every mistake and successes I&amp;rsquo;ve done through this path.

          Everything has a beginning&amp;hellip; So I decided to give it a go with this HUGO engine and start a blog with the help of it and use Typora to help me structure my posts&amp;hellip; I wonder if this is going to work well tho&amp;hellip;
Where to start with a new blog? Just testing around&amp;hellip; at the end of the day that&amp;rsquo;s what this is for actually&amp;hellip;
Everything&amp;rsquo;s complicated like giving a name to the blog&amp;hellip; So we continue our testing later on today&amp;hellip; right now need to prep for my 1v1 and my connect&amp;hellip; :)
